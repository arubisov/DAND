To Exceed Expectations

The following are some statistical tests you can perform on the dataset. Pay attention to the assumptions of the test before applying. I have attached documentation for the tests but it is up to you to do the research and find the appropriate one.

I will assume you have an understanding of Z-tests, T-tests, etc. The following tests are for some specific situations you will encounter i the dataset that we may not have gone into deeply. This part is OPTIONAL, as the rubric indicates, but will be valuable to your career.

Dependent Variable is Continuous

Mann Whitney U-test

Dependent variable is continuous
Does not assume normal distribution of the dependent variable
Often used in place of the Independent T-test when samples are not normal

One-Way ANOVA Test

Dependent variable is continuous
Dependent variable is Normally Distributed (this needs to be determined before testing.
Typically used for 3+ Independent Variables (If 2 or less, the T-test should be performed since it is easier computationally and performs just as well).

Kruskalâ€“Wallis Test

Dependent variable is continuous
Similar to an ANOVA Test but for non-normal distributions (distribution still should be determined just in case a regular ANOVA test can be performed.)
Typically used for 3+ Independent Variables (If 2 or less, the Mann-Whitney U-test should be performed since it is easier computationally and performs just as well).

Dependent Variable is Categorical

Difference in Proportions Test

Dependent variable is categorical
Typically used to compare the Dependent variable of 2 Independent-Variable Conditions
Usually involved creating a Contingency Table

Chi-Squared Test

Dependent variable is categorical
Typically used for 3+ Independent-Variable Conditions
Should be equivalent to the Difference in Proportions Test for less than 3 Conditions
Usually involved creating a Contingency Table
