### Scatterplots and Perceived Audience Size
Notes:

***

### Scatterplots
Notes:

```{r Scatterplots}

```

***

#### What are some things that you notice right away?
Response:

***

### ggplot Syntax
Notes:

```{r ggplot Syntax}

```

***

### Overplotting
Notes:

```{r Overplotting}

```

#### What do you notice in the plot?
Response:

***

### Coord_trans()
Notes:

```{r Coord_trans()}

```

#### Look up the documentation for coord_trans() and add a layer to the plot that transforms friend_count using the square root function. Create your plot!

```{r}

```

#### What do you notice?

***

### Alpha and Jitter
Notes:

```{r Alpha and Jitter}

```

***

### Overplotting and Domain Knowledge
Notes:

***

### Conditional Means
Notes:

```{r Conditional Means}
library(dplyr)
pf.fc_by_age = pf %>%
  group_by(age) %>%
  summarise(friend_count_mean = mean(friend_count),
            friend_count_median = median(friend_count),
            n = n()) %>%
  arrange(age)

head(pf.fc_by_age, 20)
  
```

Create your plot!

```{r Conditional Means Plot}

```

### Overlaying Summaries with Raw Data
Notes:

```{r Overlaying Summaries with Raw Data}
ggplot(aes(x = age, y = friend_count), data=pf) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(13,90)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.05,
             position = position_jitter(h=0),
             color = 'orange') +
  coord_trans(y = 'sqrt') + 
  geom_line (stat = 'summary', fun.y = mean) +
  geom_line (stat= 'summary', fun.y = quantile, fun.args = list(probs = .9), linetype = 2, color = 'blue') +
  geom_line (stat= 'summary', fun.y = quantile, fun.args = list(probs = .1), linetype = 2, color = 'blue') +
  geom_line (stat= 'summary', fun.y = quantile, fun.args = list(probs = .5), color = 'blue')
```

#### What are some of your observations of the plot?
Response:

### Moira: Histogram Summary and Scatterplot
See the Instructor Notes of this video to download Moira's paper on perceived audience size and to see the final plot.

Notes:

***

### Correlation
Notes:

```{r Correlation}
?cor.test
cor.test(pf$age, pf$friend_count, method='pearson')
# or, alternatively
with(pf, cor.test(age, friend_count, method='pearson'))
```

Look up the documentation for the cor.test function.

What's the correlation between age and friend count? Round to three decimal places.
Response:

***

### Correlation on Subsets
Notes:

```{r Correlation on Subsets}
with(subset(pf, age <= 70), cor.test(age, friend_count, method='pearson'))
```

***

### Correlation Methods
Notes:

***

## Create Scatterplots
Notes:

```{r}
names(pf)
ggplot(aes(x=www_likes_received, y=likes_received), data=pf) + geom_point()
```

***

### Strong Correlations
Notes:

```{r Strong Correlations}
# lm is linear model
 ggplot(aes(x=www_likes_received, y=likes_received), data=pf) + geom_point() +
  xlim(0, quantile(pf$www_likes_received, 0.95)) +
  ylim(0, quantile(pf$likes_received, 0.95)) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', color = 'red')
```

What's the correlation betwen the two variables? Include the top 5% of values for the variable in the calculation and round to 3 decimal places.

```{r Correlation Calcuation}
cor.test(pf$www_likes_received, pf$likes_received)
```

Response:

***

### Moira on Correlation
Notes:

***

### More Caution with Correlation
Notes:

```{r More Caution With Correlation}
install.packages('alr3')
library(alr3)
```

Create your plot!

```{r Temp vs Month}
data(Mitchell)
?Mitchell
ggplot(aes(x=Month, y=Temp), data=Mitchell) +
  geom_point()
```

***

### Noisy Scatterplots
a. Take a guess for the correlation coefficient for the scatterplot.

b. What is the actual correlation of the two variables?
(Round to the thousandths place)

```{r Noisy Scatterplots}
cor.test(Mitchell$Month, Mitchell$Temp)
```

***

### Making Sense of Data
Notes:

```{r Making Sense of Data}
ggplot(aes(x=Month, y=Temp), data=Mitchell) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,203,12))
```

***

### A New Perspective

What do you notice?
Response:
```{r Modulating by Year}
ggplot(aes(x=(Month%%12),y=Temp),data=Mitchell)+ 
  geom_point() 
```
Watch the solution video and check out the Instructor Notes!
Notes:

```{r Other method of understanding association?}
library(energy)
x <- seq(0, 4*pi, pi/20)
y <- cos(x)
dcor.ttest(x, y)
```

***

### Understanding Noise: Age to Age Months
Notes:

```{r Understanding Noise: Age to Age Months}
#assume it's dec 31st
# if born dec, youngest, if jan, oldest.
pf$age_with_months <- pf$age + (1 - pf$dob_month / 12)
```

***

### Age with Months Means

```{r Age with Months Means}
pf.fc_by_age_months = pf %>%
  group_by(age_with_months) %>%
  summarise(friend_count_mean = mean(friend_count),
            friend_count_median = median(friend_count),
            n = n()) %>%
  arrange(age_with_months)

head(pf.fc_by_age_months, 20)
```

Programming Assignment
```{r Programming Assignment}
ggplot(aes(x=age_with_months, y=friend_count_mean), data = subset(pf.fc_by_age_months, age_with_months < 71)) +
  geom_line()
```
Much much noisier! Obviously, since using more bins
***

### Noise in Conditional Means

```{r Noise in Conditional Means}

```

***

### Smoothing Conditional Means
Notes:

```{r Smoothing Conditional Means}
p1 <- ggplot(aes(x=age, y=friend_count_mean), data = subset(pf.fc_by_age, age < 71)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth()

p2 <- ggplot(aes(x=age_with_months, y=friend_count_mean), data = subset(pf.fc_by_age_months, age_with_months < 71)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth()

p3 <- ggplot(aes(x = round(age/5)*5, y = friend_count), data = subset(pf, age < 71)) +
  geom_line(stat='summary', fun.y=mean)

library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(p2, p1, p3, ncol=1)
```
